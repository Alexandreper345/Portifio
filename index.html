        <strong>Hello! My name is Alexandre da Silva Peroba.</strong><br>
        I am a programming student, and I started my journey in the field in 2023 with the Python language. Currently, I am studying at 42 | Rio, where I am deepening my knowledge in the C language. Throughout this journey, I have also had the opportunity to work with other programming languages, such as Rust, Java, and JavaScript, through personal and academic projects.
        In addition to my programming background, I have experience in creative fields such as photography, videomaking, and customer service, which has given me a broader perspective on communication and teamwork.
        My main goal today is to constantly evolve as a professional and as a programmer. I strive to learn more every day, deepen my knowledge, and grow with the company I am seeking opportunities with. I am always looking for new challenges that will allow me to improve my skills and contribute meaningfully.
